## Usage

### Install and Run

Just download this tool, unzip it, double click **app.exe**.
For first running, the tool will pop-up a dialog to assign the C2 root path. After that, it will show plugins and behaviors lists.
There are three kinds of plugin status.

- **NEW ARRIVING** : this plugin only on server.
- **NEW UPDATE** : this plugin has been updated, so that user might need download it.
- **LATEST** : this plugin has not been updated. So it is latest.

**Run C2Repo in administer mode if your C2 root path is on `C:\Program Files\Construct 2\`**.
